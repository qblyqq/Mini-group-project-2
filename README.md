## Bonus questions:
Economically, the impact of distance on exporting commodities is related to transportation costs and the nature of the goods being traded. 

Transportation Costs: The farther a commodity needs to travel to reach its market, the higher the transportation costs. The heavier a commodity is, the higher the cost.
Nature of Goods: Different commodities have different sensitivities to distance. Perishable items like fruits and vegetables suffer more from long distances due to spoilage risks. On the other hand, high-value goods like electronics might be less affected by distance because transportation costs form a smaller part of their overall value.

Data Needed:
Export Data: Detailed information on what each country exports and to where.
Distance Data: Distances between exporting countries and major trading partners.
Transportation Costs Data: Information on shipping costs, including rates and modes of transport.
Analysis:
Compare Distances: Calculate average distances for each commodity sector to different export markets.
Cost Analysis: Analyze how transportation costs vary across sectors and how they relate to distance. (Regression analysis)
Case Studies: Look at specific examples within sectors to understand how distance impacts trade.
